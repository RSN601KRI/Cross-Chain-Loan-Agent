# 🌐 Cross-Chain Loan Agent

**Discover the best DeFi loan options across blockchains using AI-powered autonomous agents.**  
Built with Fetch.ai’s Agentverse and powered by the ASI1-mini LLM.

## 📌 Overview

DeFi lending is highly fragmented, making it difficult to identify optimal loan terms across multiple blockchain networks. The **Cross-Chain Loan Agent** is a Web3-native solution that simplifies this process by:

- Fetching and comparing loan offers across multiple chains (Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, etc.)
- Ranking options based on user preferences like low collateral or best interest rates
- Providing easy-to-understand explanations powered by the ASI1-mini LLM
- Enabling a seamless conversational experience through the ASI:One Web App

## 🔍 Use Case

> **User query:** “What’s the best ETH loan with low collateral?”  
> **Agent response:** A ranked list of loan options from multiple chains, with detailed reasoning behind each recommendation.

## 💡 Features

- 🤖 **Conversational UI** – Ask natural language questions and receive AI-generated responses.
- 📊 **Loan Comparison Dashboard** – Visual display of interest rates, collateral ratios, lock-in periods, and platforms.
- 🔗 **Cross-Chain Intelligence** – Aggregates and evaluates loans from leading DeFi platforms across chains.
- ⚙️ **Agent-Based Architecture** – Powered by uAgents that collaborate using the Fetch.ai chat protocol.
